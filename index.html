        <p>Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
            With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in
            your HTML code.
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page
            is displayed:

            A website is a series of webpages bound together by a common domain name and displayed on web servers. Essentially, a website is a home for all the information you want to put out on the web. The information on your site is typically made up of a combination of text, images, videos and icons that come together to tell a unified story.

            <p>All of this content is added to a site using HTML, which is a markup language that web servers can read and use to display the relevant information. Nowadays, many websites can be created with website builders like Wix that enable anyone to build a site. This doesn't eliminate HTML, rather just means that it will be created for you by a tool.</p>
                
                <h3>Programming Practice: This Module is Thought by Mr. Milton</h3> <!--Thought by Mr. Milton-->
                
                <p>After the conceptualization of the internet and a series of technological advancements paved the way, the first website, as we know it today, launched in 1991. Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, is responsible for creating the world wide web and for facilitating the communication of HTML documents with web servers. This enabled content to be displayed on the internet in the way we have become accustomed to. </p>
        <h3 id="one">Database one: This Module is Thought by Mr. Lamin</h3> <!--Thought by Mr. Lamin--> 
        <p>With the surge of the internet and the general accessibility of website builders, more people are creating their own sites. Websites enable anyone to do things like sell items online or share their thoughts via a blog. However, increasingly people are also creating personal websites which simply enable them to display who they are online. 
    
            Similar to a resume or a portfolio, a personal site is a homepage dedicated to you and your accomplishments. Many people have a personal website for their careers, while others use this type of site in a similar way to a profile on social media. </p>
        <h3>Discrete Mathematics: This Module is Thought by Mr. Koroma</h3>
        <p>We strongly recommend that everyone create a site of their own to build up their online presence. The best way to do so if you are unfamiliar with languages like HTML is by using a website builder. This will enable you to drag and drop any elements you want onto your site with ease, allowing you to see what your site will look like right away. </p>
